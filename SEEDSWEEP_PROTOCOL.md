# SeedSweep Protocol — Phase-by-Phase Reset

## Overview

SeedSweep is a structured reset mechanism for Bridge OS.
It interrupts runaway processes, clears debris, and plants the next grounded step.

## The Five Phases

### 1. STOP
- Pause acknowledged (actually stopped)
- Objective stated (one sentence)
- .03 holding space

### 2. WITNESS
- Observations (what is actually happening?)
- Contradictions (what conflicts exist?)
- .03 holding space

### 3. SWEEP
- Debris items (remove, park, or keep)
- .03 holding space

### 4. SEED
- Candidates (possible next steps)
- Selected seed (the one chosen)
- Success condition
- .03 holding space

### 5. STABILIZE
- Next action (concrete, small)
- Reversible flag
- Watch-for signals
- Recheck at (optional)
- .03 holding space

## Human Gates

Each phase requires HUMAN confirmation.
ASSISTANT cannot confirm any phase.

## Stoplight Rules

- GREEN: All phases confirmed, complete
- YELLOW: In progress
- RED: Contradictions unresolved, PARK with no recheck
